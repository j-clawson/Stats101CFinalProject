# Training a Model to Classify the Extreme Durability of Rolled-Formed Aluminum

> This project was developed as part of the Stats 101C Final Kaggle Project with David Zes during the Fall 2025 quarter. Our model is built in Python and uses a stacked ensemble of CatBoost and LightGBM classifiers. Each model is trained on the provided training data, and their outputs are blended to create the final predictions.
